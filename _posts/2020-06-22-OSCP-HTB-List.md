description: A list of boxes I went through in preparation for my OSCP attempt (in order).
---

In preparation for the OSCP, these are the boxes that I went after (in this order) after my first failed exam attempt. This list is mostly based on TJ_Null’s OSCP HTB list. There’s 39 boxes in this list, but this is a great example of trying ‘harder’ and going beyond the course material.

I watched all of Ippsec’s YouTube videos on these boxes before I attempted any of them.

I’ll publish walk-throughs of all of these boxes in the coming days for you to see my methodology, where I messed up, etc.

Since this is the new site, you can view the walkthroughs on my old site at hyd3.home.blog until I port them over here.

Some of these boxes are active, so I will have to wait until they retire to publish those ones.
