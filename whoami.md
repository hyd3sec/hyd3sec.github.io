Yup. That's me. Been in IT since September of 2020, all of which has been in offsec. In that time, I've been able to learn the ropes of offensive security, obtain 15+ CVE's, do a bunch of exploit writing, knock out a bunch of certs, push out some YouTube content, and have been a Senior Penetration Tester at a Fortune 50. I'm now a Senior Security Consultant @ SpiderLabs. My bread and butter is webapp and am now starting to also focus on some advanced appsec stuff.

## Certs

OSWE - OSCP - eWPTX - GMOB - eWPT - eCPPT - eJPT - Network+ - Security+

## 14+ CVEs
